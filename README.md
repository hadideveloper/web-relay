# web-relay
It is a smart relay controller that can be triggered directly through the Internet. It performs an HTTP GET request to a user-defined URL and switches the relay ON or OFF based on the response (0 or 1). This makes it ideal for IoT applications where devices need to be controlled or monitored remotely through a simple web API.
